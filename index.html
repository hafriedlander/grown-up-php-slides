						<p>
							Hi, I'm Hamish, I'm the CTO of SilverStripe, and welcome to my talk, which has the link-bait-y
							title "Grown Up PHP"
						</p>
						<p>
							I actually struggled with the title for this talk, so as we go through I'll be bringing
							up some of the rejected titles. Both because they're still insightful, and also because
							I already wrote the slides, and I'm lazy.
						</p>
						<p>
							But basically, what I'm going to be covering is how PHP, despite it's reputation, can
							be used to write software that solves important problems. It's grown a lot since it's
							beginnings, both the language itself and the tooling ecosystem, and while the
							stink of foul slander still hangs on it to an extent, I think it's a legitimate choice for
							any size of project.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, I'm a CTO of a company that amongst other things sells PHP based solutions to large
							clients, so I have to say that. But I believe it too.
						</p>

						<p>
							So here's a rejected title
						</p>
						<p>
							Rasmus gave a great keynote yesterday that amongst other things described how PHP tries to
							"scale down" to allow non or only fractionally technical people to write websites.
						</p>
						<p>
							You are not these people though. And even the least technical person wants to be able
							to not just put a website up, but keep it up, and not be replaced by spam.
						</p>
						<p>
							So, while I'm _sure_ none of you do this, I see your secret shame - deadlines, budgets,
							there are plenty of reasons you're going to feel like you need to cut corners. But what
							I'm going to talk about is ways to avoid having to do cut corners more often - or at least make
							the decision to write terrible code on purpose.
						</p>
						<p>
							There's no excuse for this though.

					<h3>SilverStripe?</h3>
					<img width=300 style="margin-right: 100px;" src="images/sslogo.png" />
					<img width=300 src="images/ssqr.png" />

					<h3><a href="http://www.silverstripe.org">www.silverstripe.org</a></h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							So I mentioned I'm CTO of SilverStripe. And if you missed the marketing blitz we've set
							up outside, or the barrage of blue t-shirts around the place, you might be thinking
							"What is SilverStripe?". To which I say, "thank you for asking, that's an increadibly
							apropro question to ask".
						</p>
						<p>
							SilverStripe is an open source PHP-based framework for developing web applications, and a CMS
							built on that framework for developing content driven sites. It's a "modern" framework,
							MVC based and Object Oriented.
						</p>
						<p>
							SilverStripe is also the company that does a lot of the development for that framework, and
							sells both bespoke development on top of that framework, and a platform and other services
							that support that framework.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's based here in Wellington, although we've got an office up in Auckland, over in Australia
							and plans for complete world domination that _definitely_ don't involve attaching sawblades robots.
						</p>
						<p>
							The framework and CMS are completely free - BSD licensed - and easy to set up, so if you get bored,
							rather than tweeting about how much I suck, why don't you pop your laptop out, get it installed and
							check it out. Or even raise a pull request - prize for the best one.
						</p>
						<p>
							I haven't actually organised a prize though, so it's probably not going to be terribly good.
						</p>

					<h1>Just use Silver Stripe</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Here's another rejected title
						</p>
						<p>
							I'd like to think I'm only here because I'm awesome, and everyone is super interested in everything
							I have to say. But impinging annoyingly on my ego-bubble is the fact that my employeer is a sponsor
							of this conference.
						</p>
						<p>
							I don't want this to turn into an "ad disguised as a presentation" though. SilverStripe is
							definitely the solution for every problem you have, and any other decision is probably the wrong
							one. But there are plenty of people who can't make the right decision - maybe you just
							enjoy the pain a deliberately wrong decision makes, or maybe criminals are threatening your family.
							Whatever the reason for your terrible choices, it doesn't seem fair to harrass you about them
							for 50 minutes.
						</p>
						<p>
							So although I'll be discussing things I've learned while I've been working at SilverStripe, and
							how I think SilverStripe supports the goals I'm laying out here, I'll also be discussing
							the competition, and things I don't think SilverStripe solves as well as it could - yet.

					<h4>Don't wear it out</h4>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							As I've mentioned, my name is Hamish Friedlander and I'm the CTO of SilverStripe. I've been
							with SilverStripe for about 6 years now - I joined as a regular developer, but through a combination
							of advanced code noodling, flattery and blackmail I've worked my way up.
						</p>
						<p>
							I still get to do a reasonable amount of coding, although obviously I've taken on more responsibility.
							With all the fighting ninja henchmen on the lips of volcanoes, and defeating super-brain computer AIs
							from space at death-chess I don't always get to do as much as I'd like.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm also 38. And like in the movies, the fact that I've brought up that random detail so
							obviously probably means it'll be important later.

					<h3>Why grow up?</h3>
					<img width=700 src="images/moc_crop_2.jpg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							So I guess the first question to answer is - why grow up at all?
						</p>
						<p>
							It has been said that we seem to be stuck in a culture of permanent adolescence. And there's no
							question - being childish is fun. Being adult is care and responsibility and that can be scary and
							constraining.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here is a photo of some people. They're clearly being very serious and adult. And not very
							much fun at all.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h5>Trust lets us participate in</h5>
					<h3>solving important problems</h3>
					<img width=700 src="images/moc.jpg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Actually though, it's a photo from the NASA mission control center. They _are_ being
							serious and adult, but it's because they're working on something important - something
							that matters, with billions of dollars and lives on the line.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you want to work on projects like this, people need to trust you. Grown up behaviour
							leads to well though out decisions, well though out decisions lead to trust, trust leads to the
							dark side - ah, I mean, being able to work on meaningful things.
						</p>
						<p>
							And if you're not working on meaningful things - why are you doing it? Just for the money? I
							mean, that's a good reason, money buys you pretty things.
						</p>
						<p>
							But the nice thing about grown up code is that it can still be fun, you can actually make
							more money, you can work on important projects, and you can both have and eat your cake.
						</p>
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h3>So what <strong>don't</strong> I mean by grown up code?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							So lets start off with looking at a couple of traditional ways projects get developed that
							I don't mean when I say grown up.
						</p>
						<p>
							They'll form a useful counterpoint to what I discuss later.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>"Serious" / "Enterprise"</h3>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>Statically typed</li>
						<li>Heavily isolated components</li>
						<li>Pre-defined architecture</li>
						<li>Waterfall development methodology</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							First off, lets take a look at big, corporate, "serious" development. Lots of people,
							cubical farms, well defined constraints and everyone getting apportioned small segments
							of code. Massively parallel development.
						</p>
						<p>
							This sort of development isn't often done in PHP - it prefers languages that offer lots
							of constraint and isolation, so that problems can be broken down into very small pieces,
							worked on independently, and then stitched together. It needs something that provides
							lots of compile time guarantees to try and reduce the chance of regressions caused by
							this isolation.
						</p>
						<p>
							This looks grown up because everyone is super serious, and wears a suit. This model
							has a very high project failure rate though, and it has a few problems.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Problem?</h3>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>Boring</li>
						<li>Slow</li>
						<li>Can't adapt to changing requirements</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							So what are these problems?
						</p>
						<p>
							I don't think these should be new - the main problems of this style of development are fairly
							well known. It totally sucks all the fun out of development, and makes it hard to adjust
							to client requirement changes.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Also not what I mean: stereotypical "start-up"</h3>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>Cowboy / plan-less</li>
						<li>Very rapid development cycles</li>
						<li>Velocity above all</li>
						<li>Sell it now / dev it later</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Another thing that I don't mean by grown up is the stereotype of "start-up" development
							methodology. Quality, care, design, all are sacrificed to the gods of growth. Security,
							scalability, these are things that will be solved eventually, in that mythical time
							called "later".
						</p>
						<p>
							This can sometimes look serious, because there is a lot of money being thrown around,
							and surely rational human beings wouldn't spend billions of dollars unless everyone was
							trustworthy, right?

					<blockquote>&nbsp;<br />Young people are just smarter<br />&nbsp;</blockquote>

							himself - I'm not sure if he's changed his mind.

					<h3>Maybe they are though?</h3>

						<li>More likely, they just have different internal weighting to risk</li>
						<li>Works fine until it doesn't</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							But the truth is, this technique works. Sometimes. You're effectively gambling - accepting
							big risks for the potentially big payoffs that result.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's telling that once a startup makes it big, they don't keep working like this. Or at least,
							the ones that stay big don't - some gamblers just don't know when to walk away from the table.
						</p>
						<p>
							In fact, a lot of the things I'm going to describe come from start-ups that have been
							playing fast and loose, and are looking to tighten up their behaviour without loosing their
							sense of fun or their ability to react to change.

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>

						</p>
						<p>
							One of the things to notice is actually both "serious" and "start-up" development ideas
							are fine  - they're on far extremes as far as managing risk goes, but they do have legitimate uses.
						</p>
						<p>
							However they're only fine if you've analysed all your requirements and decided that the trade-offs
							are correct and they are any appropriate method. But that rarely happens. Normally people slip
							into doing whatever they're used to without really considering it.

						<h3>Agile development methodology</h3>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								The first thing you need to do is pick an agile methodology. And then, and this is the hard bit,
								actually _follow_ that methodology.
							</p>
							<p>
								It's amazing how many shops say they're "agile" or "lean" - but if you dig into those statements
								often you'll find what they actually mean is "no process" or "make it up as we go along"
							</p>
							<p>
								Remember, grown-up code is about clear comprehension of purpose leading to correct decision making.
								And a development methodology gives you tools for both resolving issues of clarity and purpose,
								and a framework for decision making.
							</p>
							<p>
								These methodologies are the true-est form of free, as they're just ideas. And most of the
								time they've been invented by developers looking to be grown up without being serious. If
								you're already in a company that has some oppressive form of waterfall, you might be stuck,
								but for everyone that just has "nothing" - why?

								The next thing is that you should almost always use a framework. Obviously at SilverStripe
								we use SilverStripe, but there are some other things that are alright too.
							</p>
							<p>
								Frameworks haven't just been developed to glorify their handsome, intelligent, well spoken
								creators. They provide existing, tested, checked against specs and confirmed by use implementations
								of things you almost always need in your apps

								Any framework worth it's salt with give you tools for dealing with a large percentage of
								security issues - content filters and escaping, XSS and CSRF protection, user management
								and encryption
							</p>

								These are things you shouldn't be doing yourself - first because there's no need to, because
								someone else has done it for you, and second because there's often catches or tricks when
								implementing this stuff.
